  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {A challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is minimizing the cost of sampling associated with exploration. Distributed exploration reduces sampling complexity in multi-agent RL (MARL). We investigate the benefits to performance in MARL when exploration is fully decentralized. Specifically, we consider a class of online, episodic, tabular \$Q\$-learning problems under time-varying reward and transition dynamics, in which agents can communicate in a decentralized manner.We show that group performance, as measured by the bound on regret, can be significantly improved through communication when each agent uses a decentralized message-passing protocol, even when limited to sending information up to its \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-hop neighbors. We prove regret and sample complexity bounds that depend on the number of agents, communication network structure and \${\textbackslash}gamma.\$ We show that incorporating more agents and more information sharing into the group learning scheme speeds up convergence to the optimal policy. Numerical simulations illustrate our results and validate our theoretical claims.},

  abstract = {Unsteady aerodynamics is central to research at the interface of fluid dynamics and control theory for low-Reynolds-number aircraft such as micro air vehicles (MAVs). The regulation and control of unsteady behavior is crucial for maintaining the stability of an MAV, which necessitates accurate modeling of their flight surfaces. When an airfoil experiences a rapid pitching motion, unsteady flow features delay the onset of stall. A dynamically pitching airfoil will typically stall at a higher angle of attack than a static airfoil, and periodic pitching introduces hysteresis loops whose amplitudes are proportional to pitching frequency and airfoil geometry. Although unsteady or dynamic stall has catalyzed the development of model characterization in fluid dynamics, an optimal control approach has not yet emerged. Earlier work [1â€“3] has used linear control laws to maximize the steady-state lift, whereas this Note describes a method to maximize the time-averaged lift using nonlinear feedback control.},
