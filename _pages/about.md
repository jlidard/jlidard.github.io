I'm a 2nd-year PhD candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at <a href="https://mae.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> advised by Professor <a href="https://naomi.princeton.edu/">Naomi Leonard</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, multi-agent systems, and control theory, primarily in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and deep learning for physical systems. I am fortunate to be supported by the <a href="https://ndseg.asee.org/">National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate</a> (NDSEG) Fellowship and the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"> National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</a> (starting Fall 2022). I have also recieved the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/nstgro">NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities</a> (NSTGRO; previously NSTRF) Fellowship. 

My graduate reserach projects have been in the field of networked, decentralized MARL. Specifically, I am interested in the case where agents learn to communicate with one other in a pro-social way. More about my current reserach intests can be found in the publications and projects page (need links).

In summer 2022, I will be doing a PhD internship at the <a href="https://www.tri.global/">Toyota Reserach Insitute</a> focusing on multi-agent interaction and prediction modeling. In summer 2020, I did a research internship at <a href="https://www.aurora.aero/">Aurora Flight Sciences Cambridge</a>. At Aurora, I worked on <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-05-13">Gamebreaker</a>, a DARPA project investigating quantitative modeling of balance in reinforcement learning games.
