Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate at [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/), where I work with [Anirudha Majumdar](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/majumdar) 
and [Naomi Leonard](https://naomi.princeton.edu/research-group/) on [robotics](https://www.princeton.edu/). During my PhD I've spent time at [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/) working on [human-interactive driving](https://www.tri.global/our-work/human-interactive-driving). 

I design algorithms that enable robots to intelligently interact with people and to improve their behavior over time. My long-term goal 
is to help robots understand people's intents and values so that robots and humans can
trust each other.
